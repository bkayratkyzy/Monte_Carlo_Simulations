## *Description/Outline*

Formula 1 is proposing to build an efficient and accurate financial model to analyze the state of the economy along with sector analyses to compare how each industry performs relative to different market conditions. One thought here is to conduct the sector analysis by using S&P 500 sector funds and comparing the performance to the S&P 500 as a base index.

Given the current global economic slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, it was importat to us as a group to incorporate urrent financial data to graph and analyze the impact of the outbreak and identify which sectors/companies could compose an "Emergency-Ready" portfolio.

## *Research Questions*

- What is the current state of the economy and how does this compare to pre-pandemic? Which industries/sectors were doing the best/worst during this time and how do they compare now?
- Which industries/sectors have improved since the outbreak? How does this compare to pre-pandemic?
- Which sectors will experience growth as a result of the outbreak?
- Value stocks/Growth stocks during this time
