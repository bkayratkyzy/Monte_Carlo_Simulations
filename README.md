**Project Description:**

Stock sector analysis using monte carlo and statistical functions.

Formula 1 is proposing to build an efficient and accurate financial model to analyze the state of the economy using sector analyses to compare how each sector performs relative to different market conditions. One thought here is to conduct the sector analysis by using S&P 500 sector funds and comparing the performance to the S&P 500 as a base index.

We will be analyzing the different sectors of the S&P 500 and forecasting with Monte Carlo. We will also look at S&P value and growth indices using Monte Carlo.  In addition,  we will analyze pre and post pandemic behavior of the sectors and indices in attempt to construct an attractive post pandemic portfolio.

Given the current global economic slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we wanted to incorporate current financial conditions to analyze the impact of the outbreak and identify which sectors/companies could compose an "Emergency-Ready" portfolio.


**Research Questions:**

What is the current state of the economy and how does this compare to pre-pandemic? 

Which industries/sectors were doing the best/worst during this time and how do they compare now?

Pre vs post pandemic comparisons:  Are some sectors outperforming or underperforming during the pandemic?

Which sectors will experience growth as a result of the outbreak?

What sectors of the S&P 500 appear most attractive for investment?

What investment style appears more attractive (Growth or Value) for investment?

Are Growth stocks or Value stocks underperforming/outperforming? Pre and post pandemic?

Is there a preferred mix of sectors/investing style post pandemic? What if pandemic trends continue for another year? What if the pandemic ends quickly?

**Datasets to be used:**

GoogleFinance/Alpaca/Quandl - S&P 500 sector etfs, S&P 500 growth and value indices. Valuation ratios - Price to Sales, P/Es, Price to book.
