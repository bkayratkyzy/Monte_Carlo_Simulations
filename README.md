**Team Members:**

1. Kelly Michelle Maldanado
2. Bulbul Yestemissova
3. Gabriel Kurflan
4. Chris Costanzo

**Project Description:**

Stock sector analysis using monte carlo and statistical functions.

We will be analyzing the different sectors of the S&P 500 and forecasting with Monte Carlo. We will also look at S&P value and growth indices using Monte Carlo.  In addition,  we will analyze pre and post pandemic behavior of the sectors and indices in attempt to construct an attractive post pandemic portfolio.


**Research Questions:**

What sectors of the S&P 500 appear most attractive for investment?

What investment style appears more attractive (Growth or Value) for investment?

Pre vs post pandemic comparisons:  Are some sectors outperforming or underperforming during the pandemic?

What sectors are most attractive post pandemic?

Are Growth stocks or Value stocks underperforming/outperforming? Pre and post pandemic?

Is there a preferred mix of sectors/investing style post pandemic? What if pandemic trends continue for another year? What if the pandemic ends quickly?

**Datasets to be used:**

GoogleFinance/Alpaca/Quandl - S&P 500 sector etfs, S&P 500 growth and value indices. Valuation ratios - Price to Sales, P/Es, Price to book.
